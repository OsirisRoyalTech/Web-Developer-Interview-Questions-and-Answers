Answer:
•	defer: Tells the browser to execute the script after the HTML document has been parsed but before the DOMContentLoaded event is fired. Scripts with defer are executed in the order they appear in the document.
•	async: Tells the browser to execute the script as soon as it is downloaded, without waiting for the HTML to be fully parsed. Scripts with async are executed immediately after they’re fetched, regardless of order.

Answer: 
Callback Hell refers to a situation where you have deeply nested callbacks, making code hard to read and maintain. It’s often a result of handling multiple asynchronous operations. To avoid it:
•	Use Promises and async/await for cleaner, more manageable code.
•	Break down complex functions into smaller, reusable functions.

Answer: 
A CDN is a distributed network of servers that cache content (e.g., images, scripts, stylesheets) to deliver it to users more quickly. 
CDNs reduce latency by serving content from servers that are geographically closer to the user, improving load times and reducing the strain on the origin server.

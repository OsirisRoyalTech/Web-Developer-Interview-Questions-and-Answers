Answer: The CSS box model defines how elements are structured and spaced on a page. It consists of:
•	Content: The actual content of the box (text, images).
•	Padding: Space around the content, inside the border.
•	Border: The border around the padding (optional).
•	Margin: Space outside the border, separating the element from others.

The Shadow DOM is a web standard that allows for encapsulating a piece of DOM (Document Object Model) in a way that it’s isolated from the rest of the document. 
This means that styles and scripts inside the Shadow DOM don’t interfere with the main document, providing a clean and reusable component-based structure.
